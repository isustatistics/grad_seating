# grad_seating

A repository for a script to construct graduate seating charts and directories 
for the ISU Statistics Department.

## Data

Let's put anonymous data in data/ and keep any non-anonymous data out of the 
repository. 

## Code

Put code here, but run it from this directory, e.g. in R

    source("code/create_fake_data.R")


## Jason says...
- `make compile` runs my code and produces outputs, assuming you have the dependencies.
- `make clean` removes all output files.
